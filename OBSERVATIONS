From the experimental results, some observations about the proposed approach are shown as follows.
The dataset which we used has 4,16,810 records
The data size affects the classification performance
When the training data is more, the model will always perform better(AWD-LSTM).The no. of records in training data are 333448.
The standard measure Accuracy is used to evaluate the performance of the model.And the metric confusion matrix is plotted to view the performance
Word Embedding is achieved using fastai TextClasDataBunch and TextLMDataBunch classes,so the emotions of the text can be effectively classified.
The proposed approach AWD-Lstm shows state of the art performance with 93.99% accuracy.  This shows the feasibility of an LSTM-based approach to text emotion classification. 
ASGD weight dropped LSTM return the average of weights of current and previous iteration which is required to identify the importance of each word in a sentence to classify text under its class(emotions).
